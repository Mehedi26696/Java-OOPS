//Single Inheritance -> One class extends another class

//Mulilevel Inheritance -> d extends c, c extends b, b extends a

//Multiple Inheritance ->  One class extends more than one class it's not directly possible in java. Because both parent class has same variable

//Herarchial Inheritance -> One class inherit by many classes

//Hybrid Inheritance -> Combination of Single and Multiple Inheritance. So that's it's not directly possible in java
